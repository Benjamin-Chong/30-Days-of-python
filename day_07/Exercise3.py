#A string is a data type that uses characters within "" or ''.
#A list is denoted by [] and can be changed after runtime
#A tuple cannot be changed after runtime and is denoted by []
#A set is denoted by a {} and is useful for checking unions, intersections, and symmetric difference. I feel like it would be useful for grouping large amounts of data.

string = 'I am teacher and I love to inspire and teach people.'
list_var = string.split()
print(list_var)
convert = set(list_var)
print(convert)
