<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Here I have created a text analyzer where the user will enter some text into a text box. Once you enter your text into the text box, the analyzer will return the following:</p>
<p> Your word count</p>
<p> The total character length</p>
<p> The most common word found in your text</p>
